There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We believe in diversifying interfaces to enhance accessibility in digital spaces. Designing eye-driven interfaces offers greater computer control for those with disabilities, while providing an alternative means of control for all users.

Eye-tracking technology shouldn't rely on expensive hardware. Many consumer electronics now have built-in cameras, and ongoing research shows that achieving accurate eye tracking with these cameras is possible.

Our mission is to democratize eye-tracking technology, making it accessible to as many people as possible.

While our technology isn't flawless, we're dedicated to continuous improvement and strive for excellence.
